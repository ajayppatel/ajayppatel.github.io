# Ajay's Personal Website

This repo contains the code for my personal website through Github pages, on Gatsby. 

Feel free to clone this repo to make your own personal website. Gatsby has a neat Github Pages package that will automatically write the generated code to a certain branch, which can be configured in the Github Pages settings to be the publishing branch - find more info [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/)! To deploy, just run the following:
```
npm run deploy
```
And the latest changes will be published on the `deploy` branch and published at [www.ajayppatel.com](www.ajayppatel.com).
